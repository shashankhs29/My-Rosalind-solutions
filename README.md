# My Rosalind Solutions
My answers for questions on Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.
I have used Python 3 for all of the questions I have solved.

PS:
DNA is stored in every cell, in a supercoiled manner, not as a straight strand 
(which would be of length ~ 2.2 m in a single human cell!).
Similarly, most of the inputs for DNA/RNA strands in the Rosalind question will not be in a long
(1000s of characters long) line, but will be split by newlines. My answers take this into account, 
so they might be a tad longer than they should be, even though some of the algorithms might be straightforward.
